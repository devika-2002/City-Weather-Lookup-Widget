Problem Statement
Your friend wants a simple webpage where they can type a city name and instantly see the current weather. 
The page should let them enter a city, click a button, and view basic weather details for that location.

API Information
To get weather information for a city, your code must follow two steps:

Convert the city name into coordinates (latitude & longitude) using the Geocoding API:
https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api

Fetch the current weather using those coordinates using the Weather Forecast API:
https://open-meteo.com/en/docs

To request the current weather in the Forecast API, include the parameter current_weather=true.
Before you start coding,, read both documentation pages carefully to understand how the request URLs work and which JSON fields you need.

Testing and Debugging
To fully understand the challenge, you should follow these two steps:

Use Postman to learn how the API behaves
Send a test request to the API endpoint.
Check the response to understand which fields you will receive.
This helps you understand what your request and response will look like before writing any code.
Build and test your project locally
Write your code on your local computer using an index.html and script.js file.
Open your HTML file in the browser to test your interface and API calls.
Use DevTools effectively:
Sources tab: to debug your JavaScript step by step and inspect variables.
Network tab: to see each request your page makes, what data was sent, and what response came back.

Your Task
Create a webpage with:
An input box for the city name.
A "Get Weather" button.
A section where the weather details will appear.
When the user clicks the button:
Call the Geocoding API to get the city’s latitude, longitude, and country.
Use the latitude and longitude, along with current_weather=true, to call the Weather Forecast API and get the temperature and windspeed.
If everything works, display the city name, country, temperature (°C), and windspeed in the weather section.
Handle errors such as:
Empty input.
City not found.
Missing weather data.
Failed API requests.
